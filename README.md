# Housing_prices
Housing prices prediction with XGBoost algorithm. The train and test datasets were obtained from a Kaggle competition. ALl the code is done ina  single Python notebook. The main considerations are:

  (1) We used label encoding to get categorical data into numerical

  (2) We performed feature engineering. We added features related to thetotal square feet of the house, age-related features, luxury features, and most importantly, we classified the neighbourhoods in terms of the meadian price of houses from the training set.

  (3) We implemented a XGBoost model with 1000 estimators (trees) and a learning rate of 0.05.
